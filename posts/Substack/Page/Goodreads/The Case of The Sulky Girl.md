## Book Review

I don't think I need to say any, those who follow me know how much I enjoy reading Perry Mason Series.    
For this book, I was hanging between 3 & 4 stars which one to give, three being honest compared to other' in the series and four just to not be too harsh on Gardner. I have decided to go with 3.

The character setup itself should hint some of the story arc to someone who has developed a little caution eye for the workings of the society. Yet, it consists of twists and turns that's expected from this series. 

Fran Celane, a happy go cranky lady, whose inheritence transfer was put into the hands of her uncle Norton approaches Mr. Mason for help. Mason accepts Fran as his client and jumps into the math of an unfortunate event that took place which pushed Fran under the bus. She's been made a prime suspect for a first degree murder! With the problem set in, the story proceeds involving Celane's bf/spouse, Norton's partner, the servants of estate in which Celane & her uncle live etc.   
Paul Drake doesn't get to have much a role to play in this story (for his fans, if any 😅)

Finally, the story ends with it not being the greatest revelation, yet has the reader engaged all through. The number of characters being limited makes the plot less complicated, losing the punch which usually exists in Perry Mason Series.
  
To conclude, if you are expecting a punch, you may not get it but it's worth a read as pass time.
